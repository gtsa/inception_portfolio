## **OtterVerse**

**OtterVerse** is a modular, Dockerized platform designed to serve as a hub for interconnected projects and applications. Built to evolve over time, it supports a diverse ecosystem of technologies and services —ranging from APIs and dashboards to blogs, backlogs, autonomous web, mobile and other apps. Scalable and extensible, OtterVerse unifies services, tools, and applications within a cohesive system powered by a microservices architecture and a centralized proxy.

### **Key Features**
- **Microservices Architecture:** A collection of modular applications, each independently developed and deployed, allowing seamless integration and scalability.
- **Multi-Technology Support:** Compatible with Ruby on Rails, React, Python, Django, Node.js, and other frameworks.
- **Dockerized Environment:** Simplified setup and deployment using Docker, with configurations for both development and production.
- **Extensible Platform:** Easily add new projects or services, such as blogs, APIs, task managers, or analytics tools.
- **Centralized Proxy:** A unified entry point for routing traffic across services using Nginx.

### **Initial Services**
1. **API:** Backend service powered by Ruby on Rails, serving as the core API for data management.
2. **Frontend:** React-based user interface for a seamless and modern user experience.
