# Modular Dockerized Architecture

## Question
**How can I create a grid of web and other types of apps that are Dockerized, using independent technologies, interconnected through a central hub web app, which only acts as a router/dispatcher for domain or subdomain addresses for each app? Additionally, how can I ensure that all these apps remain independent from each other, so that if one app or the hub goes down, the others continue functioning normally at their respective addresses?**

## Answer
This concept is excellent for building a modular system with high availability and flexibility. Below is a breakdown of how you can achieve it:

### Steps for Implementation
1. **Dockerized Apps**
   - Each app (e.g., web, API, dashboard, etc.) should have its own `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` file.
   - These apps should be isolated, ensuring the failure of one does not impact others.

2. **Reverse Proxy**
   - Use a reverse proxy like **NGINX** or **Traefik**.
   - The central hub app will act as the reverse proxy, routing traffic to the appropriate containers based on the domain or subdomain.

3. **Central Hub App**
   - The hub doesn’t need to have complex functionality.
   - It should maintain a list of domains/subdomains pointing to the respective apps and optionally include basic management tools.

4. **Addressing**
   - Use subdomains for each app (e.g., `dashboard.example.com`, `api.example.com`, `blog.example.com`).
   - Configure the reverse proxy to route traffic appropriately.

5. **Independent Operation**
   - Design the containers to be as **stateless** as possible.
   - For stateful services (e.g., databases), use external services or volumes accessible only by the respective container.

6. **High Availability**
   - If the central hub app needs to go down, the reverse proxy should continue working independently.
   - Users should still be able to visit apps directly via their domain/subdomain.

7. **Docker Networking**
   - Use Docker networks to manage communication between containers where required.
   - Ensure each app has access only to the services it needs.

8. **Failure Scenarios**
   - If an app goes down, the reverse proxy simply won’t route traffic to it.
   - If the central hub needs to be updated or taken offline, apps will remain accessible directly via their addresses.

### Recommended Tools and Technologies
- **Docker** and **Docker Compose**: For containerized environments.
- **NGINX** or **Traefik**: As the reverse proxy.
- **Certbot**: For obtaining free SSL certificates (Let’s Encrypt).
- **Consul** or **etcd**: For service discovery if dynamic address management is required.
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Use GitHub Actions, GitLab CI/CD, or similar for automated deployments.

### Example Setup
If you’d like, I can provide a specific example setup for:
- `docker-compose.yml` files for the apps and proxy.
- Proxy configuration for routing traffic to subdomains.
- Static or dynamic discovery of services for the reverse proxy.
